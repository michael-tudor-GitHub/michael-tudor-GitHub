**Founder | AI Systems Builder for Digital Agencies**

**Multi-Model AI Infrastructure • Agent Workflows • RAG Implementation • 30-Day Delivery**

I design and ship private AI systems that deliver measurable output in 30 days. I combine 20+ years of agency operations and product leadership with modern AI infrastructure to help digital agencies turn scattered experiments into cohesive systems that drive real ROI.

**Top Skills:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) • Image Generation • Prompt Engineering

## 🎯 What I Do

I advise agency owners and implement across three layers:

### AI OS
Multi-model infrastructure across text, image, audio, and video

### Application
Custom chat apps and agent workflows

### Knowledge
RAG tied to your SOPs, client context, and production data

## 📊 Outcomes I've Delivered

**Time-to-hire:** 3 weeks → 10 days with ranking, summaries, and interview kits

**Scoping/SOW/timelines:** 10 hours across multiple people → under 2 hours

**Delivery:** 3 months → 1 month across planning, build, QA, and documentation

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### Multi-Model AI Chat Platform
**October 2024 - Present**

Built a private, agency-installed chat workspace that replaces ChatGPT with model choice, shared prompts, and knowledge grounding.

- Let teams choose the model per question and compare 2 side-by-side across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google
- Grounded answers with optional RAG + citations, using agency docs and per-client knowledge bases
- Standardized workflows with a shared prompt library and agent builder for repeatable outputs

### AI ROI Dashboard
**June 2025 - Present**

Built a client-facing dashboard that shows leaders what's being used, what it's costing, and where it's paying off, down to the team and employee level.

- Made AI adoption and spend visible in real time for CEOs/CFOs across every client workspace and team
- Mapped usage to dollars by tracking messages, images, agent runs, and prompts, with time-saved estimates
- Added thumbs up/down feedback with reasons so teams improve prompts and agents based on user reactions

### Cost Analysis & Proposal Agent
**May 2025 - Present**

Built an internal estimating system that turns discovery into an approved cost model, then outputs a client-ready SOW, timeline, and task plan.

- Cut turnaround 10h to 2h by turning notes or transcripts into a draft for strategist + engineering review
- Made pricing defensible with role-based effort plus assumptions, risks, and change-order triggers
- Standardized estimates with saved roles/rates, margin on true cost, and exports (SOW, timeline, CSV task list)

### Recruitment & Retention Platform
**February 2024 - Present**

Built a hiring workspace that turns resumes and work samples into clear rankings, interview kits, and onboarding plans so teams hire faster with less overhead.

- Cut time-to-hire 3 weeks to 10 days with fit scoring, re-ranked pipelines, and apples-to-apples briefs
- Improved screening by analyzing resumes plus portfolios, writing, and GitHub, against the job description
- Produced interview kits and 30/60/90 onboarding plans to align the hiring team and set post-hire expectations

### Ad Intelligence & Generation Agent
**April 2025 - Present**

Takes a top-performing image ad and produces ready-to-review variants so teams can test more creative without adding production overhead.

- Generates 10+ fresh variants (copy, headline, image) in minutes, with human approval before anything ships
- Extracts repeatable patterns from winners (offer, hook, angle, CTA, layout) to guide the next batch of tests
- Keeps variants distinct with layout controls, then uses approval feedback to improve future rounds

## 🛠️ What I Deploy

A private, multi-model AI ecosystem for your team controlled by a secure chat UI, powered by multiple models, an agent builder, a shared prompt library, and a RAG knowledge base.

Then I add workflow tools based on your bottlenecks.

### Common Starting Points

**Proposal agent:** Discovery notes and transcripts → cost analysis, SOW, timeline, proposal

**Hiring agent:** Ranked pool → shortlists, candidate briefs, interview kits

**AI ROI dashboard:** Usage and cost by model and employee, plus agent utilization and estimated labor saved

I also build custom agents across sales, marketing, delivery, account management, and ops.
