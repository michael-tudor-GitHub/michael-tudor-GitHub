**AI Product Development • Agency Strategy • Engineering Leadership • CS Student Mentorship**

**Founder & Entrepreneur • LLM Fine-tuning • RAG & Agent Deployment • Secure AI Ecosystems**

I build practical AI products that solve hard business problems and turn technology into measurable ROI. My work spans founding and scaling companies, developing secure AI infrastructure for agencies, and mentoring CS students to ship production-ready projects. I combine deep engineering expertise with hands-on product leadership to help teams execute faster, ship better, and prove results.

## 🚀 LATEST FEATURE

### Agency Intelligence Chat

Built a secure AI chat hub that eliminates tool sprawl and off-brand output for digital agencies. Features include:

- **Governed RAG** — Connect client data, brand guidelines, and internal docs so every response is grounded in the right context
- **Built-in prompt library** — Proven workflows for proposals, audits, analytics, and content that teams can run without reinventing prompts
- **Role-based agents** — Pre-configured agents for creative, strategy, and production roles
- **Creative tools integration** — Image generation alongside secure chat, so production happens in one place
- **Performance dashboard** — Ties usage to real outcomes (hours saved, throughput, delivery KPIs) to prove ROI

**Result:** Faster, more consistent output across the agency with guardrails that keep work on-brand and grounded in client context.

## 🤝 Strategic Advisor & Consultant

I partner with CEOs and leadership teams to set growth strategy and execute across product, go-to-market, and operations. Often brought in by former competitors to:

- Develop new products and services
- Implement sales process and operational systems
- Build practical AI workflows and prompt standards (up to 10x improvement in the right roles)
- Deploy secure, private AI ecosystems that connect models, workflows, and data across teams

I advise agencies and their clients on which new models and workflows to adopt, then implement them end-to-end so teams ship faster with less rework.

## 🎓 CS Student Mentorship

I mentor select CS students using AI, data, and real business requirements to ship end-to-end projects. Focus areas include:

- Building career, communication, and internship-readiness skills
- Creating portfolios that show up in interviews
- Practical AI application development
- Production-grade project execution
- Professional skill development alongside technical mastery

Students learn to solve real problems with modern tools while developing the soft skills that separate good engineers from great hires.
